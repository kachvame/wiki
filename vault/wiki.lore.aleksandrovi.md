The Aleksandrovi family are one of the founders of Menteca. The most notable
member is Kiril Senteca with the introduction of [[wiki.guidelines.mfdd]] and
[[wiki.guidelines.kachvame]]. His legacy still lives on today in the form of
not working Evropat and code that noone knows what's doing. His descendant Murad
is still implementing the established principles passed down to him.
