Team Green, also known as "ex-google ex-facebook ex-menteca", is a team where the only requirement to join is for you to submit your [[wiki.glossary.mvp]] or be fired in the last day of your probation period. After you've provided proof that you're no longer an employee at Menteca, you'll be granted the green Discord role, thus becoming part of the team.
