The "new way" is the workflow, introduced in Menteca by the legendary PM Pano.
It was (supposed to) include a complete Jira and Confluence overhaul, proper
usage of Agile methodologies, and various other project management buzzwords.
Instead, it ended up making the Jira workflow even more convoluted and
addressing no real issues in the previous workflow.

Some say the real "new way" still hasn't commenced. We know it was supposed to
start on a Wednesday, but we're not sure which one, even long after Pano is no
longer at Menteca.

The "new way" is a silver bullet, which we'll sadly never understand fully.
Petko, the successor of Pano, was supposed to think of another way (the "newer
way"), but he still hasn't managed to uncover all of the secrets of the
effectiveness of the "new way".
