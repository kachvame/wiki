excerpt: The universal excuse for all of your mistakes
---

"I think I was drunk" is a powerful yet straightforward technique to get
yourself out of trouble. It's most effective when employed against your
coworkers, but it's also usable against upper management with various degrees of
success.

The gist of this strategy is that you make it seem like the reason for your
lousy decision is that you've made it under the influence of alcohol, and you
would've never done it if you were sober. Whether it's garbage code you've
written or a broken pull request you've approved, this method can help retain
your authority as a skilled individual while doing questionable things for
whatever reason it might be.
