MFDD stands for Malak Fix Driven Development. It is an approach to software
development that centers around deploying broken code and spending the rest of
your time at the company rolling out malki fixove for it. This powerful
technique was invented by Kiril Senteca. Most notoriously, it was heavily used
during the development of the Evropat integration, but it grew as a general way
to approach tasks in Menteca.
