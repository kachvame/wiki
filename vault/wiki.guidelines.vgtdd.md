VGTDD (Vidqh Go Tam Driven Development) is a programming paradigm based on the
concept of copying and pasting code from other parts of the project with a
similar use case. It was independently discovered by various Menteca developers
and was later unified into a single concept. The appeal of VGTDD is that it
saves the developer's precious time by allowing them to focus on getting things
to somewhat work instead of wasting their time designing clever abstractions. If
it worked before, it must work now, no need to reinvent it.
